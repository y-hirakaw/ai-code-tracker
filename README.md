# AI Code Tracker (AICT) v0.6.0

A Go-based CLI tool for tracking the proportion of AI-generated versus human-written code with **ultra-lightweight JSONL storage**, integrated with Claude Code and Git.

## 🎯 Features

- **Ultra-Lightweight**: JSONL format reduces storage by 70%+ (~150 bytes per record)
- **Branch Statistics**: Analyze AI/Human ratios by branch with regex and glob pattern matching
- **Period-Specified Reports**: Analyze AI/Human ratios for specific time ranges (--since, --last, --from/--to)
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Table, ASCII graph, JSON, and **CSV** output formats
- **Automatic Tracking**: Integrated with Claude Code hooks for automatic edit recording
- **Simple Architecture**: No baseline concept - pure differential tracking
- **Accurate Analysis**: Git numstat-based precise line counting
- **Fast Reporting**: Sub-second AI/Human ratio calculations with daily breakdown
- **Scalable**: Handles large codebases efficiently with optimized JSONL storage
- **Configurable**: Customizable tracked file extensions and exclusion patterns
- **Smart Skip**: Automatically skips recording when only non-tracked files are modified
- **Test File Handling**: `*_test.go` is excluded by default (configurable)

## 🆕 What's New

### v0.6.0
- Complete branch reporting Phase 5: `--branch-pattern` CLI option for glob-style pattern matching.
- Intelligent pattern detection automatically chooses between exact, regex, and glob matching.
- Enhanced branch filtering with four mutually exclusive options for maximum flexibility.
- Combined period and branch filtering support for complex reporting scenarios.
- Comprehensive test coverage with 133+ test cases and 95%+ coverage.

### v0.5.4
- Complete branch reporting Phase 2: `--branch`, `--branch-regex`, `--all-branches` CLI options.
- Regex-based branch grouping with per-branch breakdown and group summary.
- Overall record stats now include counts for records without branch info (shown as `main (inferred)`).
- Improved Git branch detection and normalization (handles detached HEAD and remotes).
- Validation for mutually exclusive branch flags with clear error messages.

### v0.5.3
- Introduced branch-aware JSONL records (`branch` field) and foundational analysis APIs.
- Internal plumbing for future CLI branch reporting.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

#### Option A: Direct Install (Recommended)
```bash
# Install directly from GitHub repository
go install github.com/y-hirakaw/ai-code-tracker/cmd/aict@latest

# Make sure GOPATH/bin is in your PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
# Add to your shell profile: echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
```

#### Option B: Build from Source
```bash
# Clone and build AI Code Tracker
git clone https://github.com/y-hirakaw/ai-code-tracker.git
cd ai-code-tracker
go build -o bin/aict ./cmd/aict

# Optional: Add to PATH for global access
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/bin
# Or copy to system location: sudo cp bin/aict /usr/local/bin/
```

### 2. Setup in Your Project

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your-project

# Initialize AI Code Tracker (creates .ai_code_tracking/ directory)
aict init

# Setup hooks for automatic tracking with Claude Code and Git
aict setup-hooks
```

### 3. Manual Usage

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory first
cd /path/to/your-project

# Record human code state
aict track -author human

# Record AI code state  
aict track -author claude

# Display current statistics (baseline excluded)
aict report

# Period-specified reports (v0.4.0+ features)
aict report --last 7d                    # Last 7 days
aict report --since "2 weeks ago"        # Since 2 weeks ago
aict report --from 2025-01-01 --to 2025-01-15  # Date range
aict report --last 1w --format graph     # ASCII graph format
aict report --last 1m --format json      # JSON format
aict report --last 1w --format csv       # CSV format

# Branch statistics (v0.5.4+ features)
# Note: --branch, --branch-regex, --branch-pattern, and --all-branches are mutually exclusive
aict report --all-branches               # All branches summary
aict report --branch main                # Specific branch details
aict report --branch-regex "^feature/"   # Feature branches matching regex
aict report --branch-pattern "feature/*" # Feature branches matching glob pattern (v0.6.0+)

# Reset tracking from current state (with confirmation)
aict reset
```

### 4. Automatic Usage

Automatic tracking is enabled by `aict setup-hooks`. For hook details and MCP matchers, see the "Claude Code Hooks" section below.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Customize settings in `.ai_code_tracking/config.json`:

```json
{
  "target_ai_percentage": 80.0,
  "tracked_extensions": [".go", ".py", ".js", ".ts", ".swift"],
  "exclude_patterns": ["*_test.go", "*_generated.go"],
  "author_mappings": {"y-hirakaw": "human"}
}
```

**Note**: Only files with extensions listed in `tracked_extensions` are monitored. Changes to other files (like `.md`, `.txt`) are automatically skipped for efficiency. By default in v0.5.x, `*_test.go` is excluded; remove it from `exclude_patterns` if you want to include test files.

## 🔧 Claude Code Hooks

`aict setup-hooks` creates `.claude/settings.json` (with merge confirmation for existing settings):

```json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "event": "PreToolUse",
      "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit|mcp__.*__.*edit.*|mcp__.*__.*write.*|mcp__.*__.*create.*|mcp__.*__.*replace.*|mcp__.*__.*insert.*|mcp__.*__.*override.*",
      "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.ai_code_tracking/hooks/pre-tool-use.sh"}]
    },
    {
      "event": "PostToolUse", 
      "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit|mcp__.*__.*edit.*|mcp__.*__.*write.*|mcp__.*__.*create.*|mcp__.*__.*replace.*|mcp__.*__.*insert.*|mcp__.*__.*override.*",
      "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.ai_code_tracking/hooks/post-tool-use.sh"}]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🔗 Existing Configuration Integration

`aict setup-hooks` merges with existing Git hooksとClaude設定を安全に拡張します（既存の処理は保持し、AICTの処理を追記）。競合時はユーザー確認のうえで追記し、必要に応じてバックアップを作成します。
